# object_detection
scan the object and identify multiple number of objects on screen
step 1 > open project example in vscode/android studio or any tool
step 2 > this project runs on google ml kit
step 3 > when app succesfully run you are able to see 2 option either to detect object with name and also just detect object

libraries used:
  flutter_pdfview,image_picker,camera,path_provider,google_mlkit_commons

  challenges faced- object detection in flutter possible two ways, either using tensorflow or google ml_kit, using tensor flow we need to create model, and via backend process, since this is a machine test valuation project i have used ml_kit another best practise to achieve result.
